# Square Root Computing
The aim of this project is to design and implement multiple FPGA architectures for computing the integer square root of a 2n-bit input. These architectures utilize two distinct algorithms:
- **Newtonâ€™s Method**
- **Iterative Algorithm** (computing sequentially the result bits)  

The algorithms are inspired by the proposed method in [here](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=0897444f6814a52978f4f23f5eb7db394a27727a)

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Toolchains
The module is designed to compute the square root of a **2n-bit unsigned input**, producing an **n-bit unsigned output**.

- ***Language***: VHDL
- ***Simulation***: ModelSim
- ***Synthesis***:
    - Tools: Quartus
    - Device: Cyclone V 5CGXFC7C7F23C8

### 1.2. Performance metric
Performance comparisons for each architecture were based on:
- Maximum working frequency
- Worst-case clock cycles
- FPGA resource utilization (Regs, ALMs)

## 3. Quick Run

To easily running, re-simulation, re-synthesis the project, we create a Makefile supports the following commands with `<ARCH_NUM>` in range (1,5):

| Command                      | Description                                                            |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make sim<ARC_NUM>`          | Run simulation for the corresponding architecture                      |
| `make syn<ARC_NUM>`          | Run synthesis for the corresponding architecture                       |
| `make a<ARC_NUM>`            | Run both simulation and synthesis for the corresponding architecture   |
| `make wave<ARC_NUM>`         | View the waveform for the corresponding architecture                   |
| `make view_rpt<ARC_NUM>`     | View Quartus compilation report for the corresponding architecture     |
| `make run_sim`               | Run simulations for all architectures                                  |
| `make run_syn`               | Run synthesis for all architectures                                    |

**Examples:**
- To simulate architecture 4:  
```bash
  make sim4
```
